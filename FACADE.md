# QueueFlow Go facade

This package ships an ergonomic facade (`facade.go`) layered over the generated client. It is the
recommended entry point. The generated `APIClient` and its `*APIService` groups remain available for
anything the helpers do not cover.

## Quick start

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"time"

	queueflow "github.com/elision-labs/queueflow-sdk-go"
)

func main() {
	qf := queueflow.NewQueueFlow("http://localhost:8000", "dev")

	// Enqueue a job and wait for the result.
	job, err := qf.CreateJob("echo", map[string]interface{}{"hello": "world"})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	done, err := qf.WaitForJob(job.Id, 60*time.Second, 500*time.Millisecond)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	log.Println(done.Status, done.Result)

	// Declare and run a DAG workflow.
	dag := queueflow.NewWorkflowBuilder("etl").
		Step("extract", "echo").
		Step("transform", "echo", "extract").
		Step("load", "echo", "transform")
	wf, err := qf.CreateWorkflow(dag)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	finished, _ := qf.WaitForWorkflow(wf.Id, 60*time.Second, 500*time.Millisecond)
	log.Println(finished.Status)
}
```

## API

`NewQueueFlow(baseURL, token) *QueueFlow` exposes:

- `.Client` — the generated `*APIClient` (`.Client.JobsAPI`, `.Client.WorkflowsAPI`, ...), for
  anything the helpers below do not cover.
- `CreateJob(task string, payload map[string]interface{}) (*Job, error)`
- `WaitForJob(jobID string, timeout, interval time.Duration) (*Job, error)`
- `CreateWorkflow(b *WorkflowBuilder) (*Workflow, error)`
- `WaitForWorkflow(workflowID string, timeout, interval time.Duration) (*Workflow, error)`

`NewWorkflowBuilder(name)` builds a DAG; `Build()` validates locally (duplicate names, dangling
dependencies, cycles) and returns an error before any network round-trip.

## How this package is built

The facade is injected at generation time from the queueflow-core-rs template
(`sdk-templates/go/facade.mustache`), so it is regenerated alongside the generated core and can never
drift from the server. Do not edit `facade.go` directly; edit the template.

## Worker protocol notes

The worker endpoints (`WorkerAPI`: lease, heartbeat, complete, fail) are exposed as raw calls;
no worker runtime ships with this SDK. If you build one on top, three rules keep the
at-least-once contract honest:

1. Worker routes authenticate with the **worker token**, not a tenant token. Build a second
   client for it (`NewConfiguration()` + `AddDefaultHeader("Authorization", "Bearer "+workerToken)`).
2. Heartbeat every in-flight job at roughly half its lease interval. A heartbeat whose `status`
   is anything other than `running` (or an HTTP 409) means the server owns the outcome: abandon
   the handler and report nothing. Never process a leased batch sequentially without
   heartbeating the jobs still waiting - their leases expire and the server redelivers them.
3. Delivery is at-least-once, so handlers must be idempotent. Report permanent failures with
   `retryable: false` so they dead-letter immediately instead of burning retries.

## Known limitation: StreamJobEvents

`JobsAPI.StreamJobEvents` cannot consume the server's SSE stream: it buffers the whole response
until the stream closes (terminal status or the 15-minute cap) and returns it as one string.
Use `WaitForJob` (polling) instead, or a hand-rolled SSE consumer over
`GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}/events`.
